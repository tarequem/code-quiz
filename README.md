# About
* This page was programmed with the intent of testing the user on their programming knowledge. When the quiz starts, a timer starts counting down. For each incorrect answer, 10 seconds get deducted from the timer. The final score is based on how quickly the user can finish the quiz with as few penalties as possible. The user can then enter their initials and save their score. The user can also view all previous scores and is able to clear them.
